# the-unbidden
Game created for the global gam jam 2017. The theme of the project was waves. 
So we decided to create this character who has 3 states corresponding to different kind of waves (light, sound, electromagnetic). Game created with unity.

# How it works
You have 3 states light, sound and magnetic that you can switch with A Z E and to move is arrow keys. You have a special power that you can activate with spacebar.
Sound : you shoot a beam that moves crates
Light : you can dash forward and you can pass through glass
Magnetic : you can stick to metal surfaces
